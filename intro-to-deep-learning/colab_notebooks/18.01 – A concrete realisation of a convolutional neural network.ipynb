Some things to keep in mind:\n","\n","1. I can most likely not hear you, thus you will have to “speak through” Pasquale – a researcher in my team and TA for the module – who is present at the lecture.\n","\n","2. I can also most likely not see you, this is extremely awkward, expect some odd pacing.\n","\n","3. Although I spent about an hour yesterday stabilising the WiFi connection, it could go flaky.

Marking almost done, apologies for the delays.\n","\n","2. Overall, I am very very impressed. Many of you are above 90 and it is well deserved.\n","\n","3. But… pretty please, do not hand in hundreds of pages with printouts. Try to cut out what is not relevant, especially, we really can not read your weight matrices.\n","\n","## Assignment 2 ##\n","\n","1. I have heard rumours about issues with slowdowns on Colaboratory, is this still the case and how many are affected?\n","\n","2. For those with questions in my inbox, I hope to get around to them shortly after this lecture.\n","\n","3. Can you comment on the difficulty of Assignment 2? Just right? Too difficult? Too easy? In terms of effort? Too much? Too little?\n","\n","## Assignment 3 ##\n","\n","1. To be finalised and distributed tomorrow (Friday), awaiting last adjustments based on your feedback on Assignment 2.\n","\n","2. Timetabling has still not gotten back to me about additional tutorials in January, how about we run a tutorial (support) session at the UCL Centre for Artificial Intelligence from 15:00 to 18:00 on January 13th akin to what we did last week? My impression was that one-on-one help was very much appreciated by the students. It also gives you time before that Friday (January 17th) when the assignment is due.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"900dqb9wKoXJ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# A concrete
