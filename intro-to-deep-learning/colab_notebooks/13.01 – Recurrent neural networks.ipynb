But at this point, we can draw parallels to how we know that while neural networks are universal function approximators, we do know that ultimately we are limited by what we can learn given finite amounts of data and compute. So, how complex of a behaviour can these models learn?\n","\n","![](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/40be3888daa5c2e5af4d36ae22f690bcc8caf600/5-Figure2-1.png)\n","\n","[Image source](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Visualizing-and-Understanding-Recurrent-Networks-Karpathy-Johnson/40be3888daa5c2e5af4d36ae22f690bcc8caf600)\n","\n","From [“Visualizing and Understanding Recurrent Networks”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02078) by Karpathy et al.
